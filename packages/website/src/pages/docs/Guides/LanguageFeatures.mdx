# Language Features 

## Program Structure

A Squiggle program consists of a series of definitions (for example, `x = 5`, `f(x) = x * x`). This can optionally conclude with an *end expression*.

If an end expression is provided, it becomes the evaluated output of the program, and only this result will be displayed in the viewer. Otherwise, all top-level variable definitions will be displayed.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
y = 10
x + y`}
/>

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
y = 10`}
/>

## Immutability

All variables in Squiggle are immutable, similar to other functional programming languages like OCaml or Haskell.

In the case of container types (lists and dictionaries), this implies that an operation such as myList[3] = 10 is not permitted. Instead, we recommend using `List.map`, `List.reduce` or other [List functions](/docs/Api/List).

In case of basic types such as numbers or strings, the impact of immutability is more subtle.

Consider this code:

```squiggle
x = 5
x = x + 5
```

While it appears that the value of x has changed, what actually occurred is the creation of a new variable with the same name, which [shadowed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing) the previous x variable.

In most cases, shadowing behaves identically to what you'd expect in languages like JavaScript or Python.

One case where shadowing matters is closures:

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
argPlusX(y) = x + y

x = x + 5

argPlusX(5)`}
/>

In the above example, the `argPlusX` function captures the value of `x` from line 1, not the newly shadowed `x` from line 4. As a result, `argPlusX(5)` returns 10, not 15.

## Blocks

Blocks are special expressions in Squiggle that can contain any number of local definitions and end with an expression.

<SquiggleEditor
defaultCode={`x = { 5 } // same as "x = 5"
y = {
  t = 10 // local variable, won't be available outside of the block body
  5 * t // end expression
}
`} />

## Conditionals

If/then/else statements in Squiggle are values too.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`x = 5
if x<8 then 10 else 3`}
/>

See [Control flow](/docs/Guides/ControlFlow) for more details and examples.

## Comments

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`// This is a single-line comment\n
/*
This is a multiple
-line comment.
*/
foo = 5

/**
This is a docstring.
Because it starts with "/**", it will be displayed in the viewer if it precedes a public variable definition.
*/
bar = 6
`}
/>

## Pipes

Squiggle features [data-first](https://www.javierchavarri.com/data-first-and-data-last-a-comparison/) pipes. Functions in the standard library are organized to make this convenient.

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`normal(5,2) -> truncateLeft(3) -> SampleSet.fromDist -> SampleSet.map({|r| r + 10})`}
/>

## Standard Library

Squiggle features a simple [standard libary](/docs/Api/Dist).

Most functions are namespaced under their respective types to keep functionality distinct. Certain popular functions are usable without their namespaces.

For example,

<SquiggleEditor
  defaultCode={`a = List.upTo(0, 5000) -> SampleSet.fromList // namespaces required
b = normal(5,2) // namespace not required
c = 5 to 10 // namespace not required`}
/>

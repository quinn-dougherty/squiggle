## 0.5.0

- Performance improvements:
  - Interpreter is now 5x-20x faster on code written in Squiggle
  - SampleSet to PointSet conversions are 2x faster
  - cdf function on SampleSets is 30x faster
  - overall speedup is about 2x on average on real code written in Squiggle
- 50% smaller bundle size for [@quri/squiggle-lang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-lang); 20% smaller bundle size for [@quri/squiggle-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quri/squiggle-components).

### Breaking changes

Some rarely used math functions got removed or moved to the `Math` namespace.

For example, `cos(x)` is now `Math.cos(x)`, and `atanh(x)` doesn't exist.

If your code is now failing with `<function> is not defined` for anything from [this list](https://mathjs.org/docs/reference/functions.html), try adding `Math.` prefix first, and then complain on [Github issues](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/squiggle/issues).

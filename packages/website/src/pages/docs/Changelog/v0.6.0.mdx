## 0.6.0

- Language reimplemented in Typescript instead of Rescript.
- 2x performance boost on average on typical Squiggle code. Most improvements come from optimizations in distribution operations.
- Color fixes and improved distribution charts in components.
- `mean()` on mixed pointsets now works correctly.

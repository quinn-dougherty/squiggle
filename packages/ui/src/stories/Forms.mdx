We provide form components for several layers of abstraction.

We'll explain them here, starting from the most convenient (and least flexible) to the underlying generic components.

Most form components we have are tightly coupled with [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/).

# Specific form field components

First, there are input-specific `*FormField` component: `<TextFormField>`, `<ColorFormField>` and so on. These components are type-safe wrappers around `<FormField>` and `<ControlledFormInput>` (explained in the next section). You should use these components unless you need to do something nonstandard.

Example:

```typescript
<TextFormField
  name="foo"
  label="Foo"
  description="Foo described"
  rules={{ required: true }}
/>
```

Note that here and for all following components (except for `<Styled*>` versions) your form must be wrapped in `<FormProvider>`.

So the full example looks like this:

```typescript
const MyForm = () => {
  const form = useForm();

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(...)}>
      <FormProvider {...form}>
        <TextFormField
          name="foo"
          label="Foo"
          description="Foo described"
          rules={{ required: true, pattern: /^\w+$/ }}
        />
        <TextAreaFormField name="bar" label="bar" description="Bar described" />
      </FormProvider>
    </form>
  );
};
```

# Generic field components

Second, there are more generic `<FormField>` and `<ControlledFormField>` components. These components allow you to combine any custom input component with standard labels and descriptions.

Example (this is a simplified version of `<TextFormField>`):

```typescript
<FormField name="slug" label="Slug" description="Model slug">
  {(props) => <StyledInput type="text" {...props} />}
</FormField>
```

Field components take the following arguments:

- `name`, `label`, `description` — same as for specific form field components.
- `inlineLabel` — boolean flag, if set, custom content is rendered first, and label is rendered after it in the same row.
- `standaloneLabel` — boolean flag; if set, label won't wrap children and clickable area will be reduced. This is useful for some custom fields where outer label leads to too large clickable area.

# Generic input components

Third, there are `<FormInput>` and `<ControlledFormInput>`. These allow you to render an input with its React Hook Form error message, while doing a custom layout.

These are more generic, and the only style decision that they impose on you is that the errors are always displayed as a tooltip.

Example:

```typescript
<FormInput name="foo">
  {(props) => <StyledInput type="text" {...props} />}
</FormInput>
```

# Styled

Lastly, there are `Styled*` components: `<StyledCheckbox>`, `<StyledTextArea>` and so on. These mostly map on native HTML elements, and take similar props, but are styled with Tailwind. They don't require React Hook Form and can be used anywhere.

Example:

```typescript
<StyledTextArea value="initial text" placeholder="write text here" />
```

# Sweep AI turns bugs & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev/usage/config

# This setting contains a list of rules that Sweep will check for. If any of these rules are broken in a new commit, Sweep will create an pull request to fix the broken rule.
rules:
  - "All docstrings and comments should be up to date."
  - "Ensure that all variables and functions have descriptive names."
  - "Avoid using unnecessary separators or extra characters in code."
  - "Use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code."
  - "Ensure that all code is properly formatted and follows the style guide."
  - "Avoid using magic numbers or hard-coded values in the code."

# This is the branch that Sweep will develop from and make pull requests to. Most people use 'main' or 'master' but some users also use 'dev' or 'staging'.
branch: 'main'

# By default Sweep will read the logs and outputs from your existing Github Actions. To disable this, set this to false.
gha_enabled: True

# This is the description of your project. It will be used by sweep when creating PRs. You can tell Sweep what's unique about your project, what frameworks you use, or anything else you want.
#
# Example:
#
# description: sweepai/sweep is a python project. The main api endpoints are in sweepai/api.py. Write code that adheres to PEP8.
description: 'A custom programming language that works with probability distributions. Contains several packages. "squiggle-lang" is the language, "components" is a set of high-level React components, "hub" is a web application that stores Squiggle code, similar to Github, and "website" is for documentation.'

# This sets whether to create pull requests as drafts. If this is set to True, then all pull requests will be created as drafts and GitHub Actions will not be triggered.
draft: True

# This is a list of directories that Sweep will not be able to edit.
blocked_dirs: []

# This is a list of documentation links that Sweep will use to help it understand your code. You can add links to documentation for any packages you use here.
#
# Example:
#
# docs:
#   - PyGitHub: ["https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/", "We use pygithub to interact with the GitHub API"]
docs:
  - Squiggle: ["https://www.squiggle-language.com/docs", "Our main language. This comes from this repo, but is used in many parts of it."]
  - Codemirror: ["https://codemirror.net/docs/", "We use codemirror in /packages/components, for our editor"]
  - d3: ["https://d3js.org/getting-started", "We use d3 for components, for charts and diagrams."]
  - React: ["https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html", "We use React for all frontend stuff"]
  - Pathos: ["https://pathos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pathos.html", "Used in /components/hub for our GraphQL Server"]
